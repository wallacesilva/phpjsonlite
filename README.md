# PHP JSONlite

##### A simple, self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, [json](http://www.json.org/) document store. Based on [nodesocket/jsonlite](https://github.com/nodesocket/jsonlite).

JSONlite sandboxes the current working directory just like [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). The data directory is named `jsonlite.data`, and each json document is saved pretty printed as a uuid.

## Proof of Concept

JSONlite is a proof of concept, and it may not make any sense to actually use it in development or production. Read more in [nodesocket/jsonlite](https://github.com/nodesocket/jsonlite).

## Installation

```
composer require wallacesilva/phpjsonlite
```

## Requirements

1. php >= 5.3

## Usage

> You need declare the object to use the methods.

```php
$jsonlite = new JSONlite\JSONlite();
// e.g.: $jsonlite->methodName();
```

#### set(```<string> $object [, <string> $document_id=null]```)

> Set object using OR not document_id

````php
$object = array(
    'id'            => 1, 
    'name'          => 'John Doe', 
    'active'        => true, 
    'permissions'   => array(
        'read'      => true,
        'write'     => false,
        'execute'   => true
    )
);
$document_id = $jsonlite->set($object);
// return also like: '666B81D6-3F8A-4D57-BA3F-11FA8FC47246'
````

#### get(```<string> $document_id```)

> Get object using document_id. Document id is a UUID 

````php
$object = $jsonlite->get($document_id);
// return also like:
/**
{
    "active": true,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "permissions": {
        "read": true,
        "write": false
    }
}
*/
````

#### delete(```<string> $document_id```)

> Delete object using document_id.

````
$deleted = $jsonlite->delete($document_id)
````

#### drop()

> Remove database folder. Default './jsonlite.data'

````php
$jsonlite->drop()
````

#### setDataPath(```<string> $dataPath```)

> Define new folder database. This is not required. Default is './jsonlite.data'

````
$jsonlite->setDataPath('/var/www/database/jsonlite.data/');
